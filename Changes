Revision history for Geo::ShapeFile.

2.51  Thu May 12 11:01:41 EDT 2005
    - Corrected a stupid math problem in Geo::ShapeFile::Shape::centroid
      function, reported by an anonymous rt.cpan.org user.
    - Fixed a problem discovered by Celia Mackie, where some complex shape
      types didn't have their Z and M values transferred into the points
      correctly, making it difficult to access those values.

2.50  Sat Jul  3 19:08:50 EDT 2004
    - things calming down at new job, more free time at home for pet projects.
      hopefully this means more Geo::ShapeFile support to come (as well as
      posting some new modules in progress)
    - fixed windows bug reported by Patrick Dughi
    - object caching
    - fixed another windows bug reported by A. B. Jones
    - fixed dumb regexp bug that wouldn't let you use directories with a dot in
      them (doh!).  Reported by Leo WEST
    - fixed documentation bug for shapes_in_area reported by Chad Harp
    - fixed endianess bug reported by Daniel Gildea
    - fixed some count issues, and code cleanup reported by Fergus McMenemie
    - documentation clarification suggested by Christopher Eykamp
    - fixed divide by zero bug when using angle_to() on points with the same
      X value, reported by Frank Maas
    - fixed bug where has_point() missed points that fell exactly on the
      boundary of the area specified, reported by Frank Maas
    - modified dbf file reader to correctly load DBF files that don't have
      an end-of-file marker byte.  This should correct the 'file size off
      by one byte' bug first reported by Attila Csipa (sorry it took so long,
      I couldn't find data that reproduced it), patch submitted by
      Aleksandar Jelenak.
